The ESP cells shall be of a floating plate design to eliminate plate warpage during high heat operation. Each cell shall have 9 Tungsten wires run perpendicular to the air flow which will ionize the air stream. Spike type systems are unacceptable. The cells shall be positioned on slide tracks so that they may be easily removed through a hinged cell access door. For ease of handling, individual cells shall weigh less than 54 lbs. There shall be removable, cleanable debris screens located immediately upstream of the ESP cells and a moisture separator immediately downstream. \n4.\tAn electrical panel mounted on the unit shall contain the high voltage power pack assembly, safety disconnect switch, main disconnect switch, fuses and a magnetic starter for the exhaust fan. The safety disconnect switch shall interface with the electrical panel access door such that when opened it will shut off service to the power packs and ground them to drain the residual electrical charge from both the power packs and ESP cells. The ESP cell access door shall interface with the electrical panel access door so that it cannot be opened without first opening the electrical panel access door. The high voltage power packs shall be self-limiting type and shall be self-contained. The electrical panel shall include indicating lights to monitor cell and transformer voltage. The main disconnect switch for the exhaust fan and control circuits shall lock the electrical panel access door closed when in the on position. \n5.\tThe unit shall contain several oscillating wash manifolds with Conserva-Clean spray nozzles to wash the ESP cells with hot detergent injected water each time the exhaust fan is shut off. Maximum required wash pressure is not to exceed 2.06 bar at 60 Degree C (30PSI at 140 Degree F). Maximum water flow rate per cell is not to exceed 2.3GPM.\n6.\tThe controls for the operation of the Exhaust Fan, ESP, Wash System and Fire Cycle of the Pollution Control Unit shall be an integral part Pollution Control System Control Panel.

There shall be a removable panel for access to the fan.\n11.\tThe exhaust fan shall be installed with spring isolation with 1 deflection and a flex connection to properly isolate the fan from the duct work. If isolation is provided the fan shall be housed to provide a fire barrier for the flex connections and to comply with NFPA 96. \n12.\tThe unit shall be equipped with a thermostat, set at 121.1 degrees C (250F), located in the smoke control section of the unit. The thermostat shall be interfaced with the exhaust hoods and Pollution Control System Panel such that in the event of a fire condition, when the thermostat reaches its set point of 121.1 degrees C (250F), the system control goes into a fire mode. The fire mode shall shut off the exhaust fan, and turn on the wash sprays in the pollution control unit. \n13.\tThe unit housing shall be constructed of a minimum of 16-gauge G90 bright galvanized steel. The perimeter base shall be 12 gauge formed channel with lifting lugs at each corner and along the length as required. The internal housing shall be externally welded liquid tight for compliance to the International Mechanical Code and NFPA-96 grease duct construction requirements.\n14.\tThe unit shall be supplied with a minimum of one extra ESP cell of each type of cell and one soak tank.
