<p>When the application is first opened, you will be greeted by a window with five buttons and three text boxes.  The buttons labeled &quot;select input file&quot; and &quot;select output folder&quot; will open a file explorer window. The &quot;select input file&quot; button expects that you select the Utility Loads excel export from AutoQuotes (must contain the following columns: &quot;AMPS&quot;, &quot;KW&quot;, &quot;GPH&quot;/&quot;LPH&quot;, &quot;BTUS&quot;, &quot;EXH CFM&quot;, &quot;SUPPLY CFM&quot;, &quot;VOLTS&quot;, &quot;PH&quot;, &quot;HEAT REJECTION&quot;), and the &quot;select output folder&quot; button expects that you select the location you want the application to save the formatted Utility Loads sheet to. The three text boxes start filled with the numbers: 120, 208, and 480. These are the acceptable voltages. Any voltage on the formatted sheet that isn&#39;t one of these numbers will be highlighted in yellow for later review. You can change the numbers in the text boxes, but they must remain as whole numbers. You can also increase the number of text boxes, and therefore the number of acceptable voltages (up to 5), by clicking the &quot;+&quot; button. Likewise you can reduce the number of text boxes, and number of acceptable voltages, by clicking the &quot;-&quot; button (minimum of 1). </p>
<p>When you are ready to create the formatted utility loads sheet (filled acceptable voltages and selected input/output locations). You can click the &quot;format file&quot; button. This button will create a new file where the following columns are summed: &quot;KW&quot;, &quot;GPH&quot;, &quot;BTUS&quot;, &quot;EXH CFM&quot;, &quot;SUPPLY CFM&quot;, &quot;HEAT REJECTION&quot;, KW are calculated for each item, items with multiple electrical utilities are separated into different rows for each utility, and any utility which is summed and has a quantity is multiplied by that quantity.</p>
