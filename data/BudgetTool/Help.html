<p>When the application is opened, you will be greeted by a window with three buttons and two text boxes. The textbox under &quot;Markup Percent&quot; will be used in the formatted budget sheet to calculate the total cost for a project. The text box under &quot;Enter Good Through Date:&quot; is also used in the formatted budget sheet to indicate when this formatted budget sheet is valid.</p>
<p><img src="./html images/Application_Window.PNG" alt="Example of Format Budget Window"></p>
<p>Both the &quot;Select Input File&quot; button and the &quot;Select Output Folder&quot; button will open a file explorer window when clicked. The &quot;Select Input File&quot; button expects that you select an Excel file exported from AutoQuotes which contains the following headers: &quot;ItemNo&quot;, &quot;Qty&quot;, &quot;Category&quot;, &quot;Sell&quot;, &quot;Remarks&quot;, &quot;Spec&quot;, &quot;Model&quot;, &quot;Unit&quot;, &quot;SellTotal&quot;. The &quot;Select Output Folder&quot; button expects that you select the location you want this application to save the formatted Excel sheet to. Both the paths for the input file and output folder will be displayed in the window after they have been selected.</p>
<p>When  you are ready to create the formatted budget file (input/output location set, and text boxes filled), you can click the button labeled &quot;format file&quot;. </p>
<p>The application will then use the information from the supplied AQ export to create a formatted Budget sheet at the provided location. During formatting, the application will skip over any rows which has a non-white background (r, g, or b values less that 0xEF), sets the sell column of NIC items to &#39;NIC&#39;, sets qty of SpareNo items to &#39;-&#39; and sell to empty, sets qty of custom fab items which use ft as units to 1, and sums the SellTotal of all items at the bottom of the sheet before applying the markup percent. </p>
